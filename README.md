# Tweeter Project

Hello! Welcome and thank you for downloading my Twitter clone, Tweeter!

## About

This is a pure learning experience and educational project, as well as my first foray into creating a website with jQuery and Ajax.

This simple clone takes from an array of premade users, handles, and creates a tweet from the text you typed from the text-input field!
